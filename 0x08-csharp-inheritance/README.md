# C# - Inheritance

## This Is One of These
Check whether an object is an `int`.

## For Instance
Check if an object is an instance of a class or one of its subclasses.

## Only Subclass
Check if a type is a subclass of another type.

## Type
Print the property and method names of a type.

## It's Not a Lesson in Classes and Inheritance without a Dog
Simple base and subclass.

## Basic Shapes
A simple base class with one virtual method.
